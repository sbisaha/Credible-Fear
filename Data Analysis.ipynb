    "# The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Reserachers at the University of California, Berkeley's Human Rights Center organize and cleaned public immigration data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and judge data from the Transcational Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). \n",
    "\n",
    "They then shared their cleaned data with us. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was pulled for January 2022.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Proceedings that did not have a final decision, which made up about 41% of the initial data pull, were stripped from the data. The reserachers say \"this could be due to an oversight in recording, the data being corrupted or other reasons.\" The data does not include the asylum seekers explanation for leaving their country. Later in the notebook, we checked with another spreadsheet (one that did not have dropped cases) to see how many credible fear review cases and ones involving Cameroonians were dropped. The numbers were small and would have a negligible affect on the analysis (only one dropped case with Cameroonians and the largest percent of dropped CFR cases was in 2021 with 3.7 percent). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we learned\n",
    "\n",
    "We affirmed the data in this line: A previous analysis by the students of the Human Rights Center Investigations Lab showed that immigration judges upheld more than 72% percent of all credible fear determinations they reviewed between 2018 and 2021.\n",
    "The line this pertains to in the story: \"...showing that immigration judges nationally upheld 72.23% of all credible fear determinations they reviewed between 2018 and 2021.\" \n",
    "The analysis for this can be found under the question: \"What is the national rate for credible fear reviews that side with ICE?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found that Judge Landis, the judge who ruled that BJ's fears were not credible upheld 99.3 percent of the negative determinations that came before him during that time — keeping the Xs in place for all but 2 out of 314 asylum seekers. Between 2019 and 2021 Landis upheld all negative credible fear determinations that he reviewed.\n",
    "The analysis for this can be found under the question: \"What was judge Landis rate for siding with ICE on credible fear reviews after 2018 (only looking at 2019, 2020 and 2021)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis for this line: \"Between 2018 and 2021, Louisiana judges upheld 93.7% of all negative credible fear determination that came before them in reviews.\"\n",
    "...can be found in the section \"What is the Louisiana rate for credible fear review that side with ICE?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The NATIONALITY column, which denotes the origin country for the asylum seeker, had an error for Cameroonians where an extra character was added. One of the researchers removed the character for us. "

    "'data_final.csv' is the cleaned data provided for us from the researchers. We used the Python library pandas to analyze the data. Due to the size of the file, we are only pulling in specific columns to make the processing easier. Here are the columns and what each denote, based on a codebook provided by the researchers:\n",

    "- DECISION_DATE-YEAR: The year on which the immigration judge rendered a decision on the proceeding\n",

    "- BASE_CITY: The code that represents the immigration court having jurisdiction over the assigned hearing location\n",
    "- DECISION: Whether the asylum seeker was granted asylum\n",
